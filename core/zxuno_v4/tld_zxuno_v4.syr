    WARNING:Xst:2708 - You have instructed XST to treat asynchronous set and reset signals as if they are synchronous. Please carefully review the following points to understand if any implications exist for your particular design:
         1) This automatic transformation allows you ensure a more optimal implementation of flip-flops and latches on Xilinx devices, and to better leverage essential device resources, such as DSP blocks and Block RAMs. You will therefore be able to assess the full potential of the Xilinx solution that you are evaluating, in terms of device usage and circuit performance, without having to rewrite the description of sequential elements in your design description.
         2) The post-synthesis netlist is theoretically not functionally equivalent to your pre-synthesis HDL description.
         3) However, if not actually using the asynchronous sets and resets that you have described, or if they are derived from synchronous sources, the post-synthesis solution will be functionally equivalent.
         4) If successfully achieving your design goals through this transformation, please carefully review whether your HDL description should be changed to enforce synchronous sets and resets, in order to ensure the expected circuit behavior, or to ease your design validation process.
         5) Xilinx generally recommends to use synchronous set and reset signals.
         6) In any case, a timing simulation is highly recommended for you to understand any ramification for your particular design situation.

INFO:Xst:3218 - HDL ADVISOR - The RAM <Mram__n0438> will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings. Please refer to your documentation for coding guidelines.

INFO:Xst:3218 - HDL ADVISOR - The RAM <Mram_Std9bitColour> will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings.

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 7-bit shift register was found for signal <relojes_maestros/pulso_reconf_7> and currently occupies 7 logic cells (3 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
